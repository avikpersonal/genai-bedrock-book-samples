Executing Jupyter Notebooks and cloning example source code enables hands-on learning and practical engagement with concepts. By running code directly, users can better understand the mechanics of each example, experiment with modifications, and troubleshoot in real time, deepening their knowledge and enhancing their skill development.

## Executing Jupyter Notebooks

1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, type **"sagemaker"**. Then, select **Amazon SageMaker**.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are running this in your own account, please be aware that costs may be incurred. The exact expenses depend on factors such as the frequency of your calls to Bedrock, the length of tokens or the size of images in your calls, and the specific models you utilize. For detailed pricing information for each model, please refer to the Amazon Bedrock console. Even, you will get specific note before every exercises. 

## Clean up

If you dont want to continue with this hands on exercise further, Please follow the **Delete** the AWS CloudFormation stack to avoid incurring future charges and to clean up unused roles and policies, delete the resources you created as part of the execution of the AWS CloudFormation stack.
