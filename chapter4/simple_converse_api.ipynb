Her mother smiled and explained that rainbows were created by the reflection of light from water droplets in the air. Lily was amazed and couldn't stop talking about the rainbow she had seen. From that day on, Lily always looked for rainbows in the sky and felt grateful for the beauty of nature.\n",
