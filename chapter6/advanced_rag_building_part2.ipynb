    "### To initialize a Bedrock LLM model, configure a query engine, and execute a multi-step query using step decomposition. The process involves several stages, with comprehensive error handling to ensure smooth execution. Below is a detailed breakdown of each part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Initializing the Bedrock LLM Model: The first step is to initialize a Bedrock LLM model using a specified model ID (bedrock_model_id).\n",
    "### 2. Setting Up Step Decomposition Transform: To handle complex queries by breaking them into smaller, more manageable steps, a step decomposition transform is created.\n",
    "### 3. Defining the Index Summary: An index summary is defined to provide a concise description of the content within the index. In this case, it is set to \"Cash Flow\", which will be used as part of the query process.\n",
    "### 4. Configuring the Primary Query Engine: The query engine is configured by transforming the existing VectorStoreIndex into a query engine that integrates with the Bedrock LLM model.\n",
    "### 5. Setting Up the Multi-Step Query Engine: A multi-step query engine is created to allow for advanced query processing that includes the step decomposition transform and the defined index summary.\n",
    "### 6. Executing the Query: Once the multi-step query engine is set up, the next step is to execute a query using the engine. The query is provided as the prompt variable, which is passed into the query_engine.query(prompt) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Considerations:\n",
    "##### Verbose Logging: The verbose=True flag in StepDecomposeQueryTransform ensures that detailed logs are generated, which can help in debugging the decomposition process.\n",
    "##### Complex Queries: The use of a multi-step query engine enables the handling of more complex queries by breaking them down into smaller steps.\n",
    "##### Model Integration: The integration of the Bedrock LLM into the process allows the query engine to leverage powerful language model capabilities for better response generation."
