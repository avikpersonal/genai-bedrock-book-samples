Section 1: Executing AWS Cloud Formation scripts
Purpose : Provisioning resources in your own AWS account for **A Definitive Guide to Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock** Book code hands on

---

To expedite the implementation of practising all the exercise of **A Definitive Guide to Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock** book, you can use the AWS Cloud Formation template [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) for your convenience. AWS CloudFormation serves as a powerful management tool, enabling you to define and provision all necessary infrastructure resources within AWS using a unified and standardized language.

> [!Disclamer]
> This CloudFormation template creates an Amazon SageMaker domain with IAM roles and policies for the Amazon Bedrock Book. It is intended for practice purposes and does not adhere to least privilege best practices. You can use this template as a foundation and modify it to implement least privilege based on your specific requirements. 

The AWS CloudFormation template will create following things: 

**Parameters:**

    1. UserProfileName: Defines the name of the user profile for SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, with a default value of genalbookbedrocksagemakeruser.

**Resources:**

    1. SageMaker User Profile (GenAIBookBedrockSageMakerUser): Creates a user profile for SageMaker, using an execution role specified in the GenAIBookBedrockSageMakerExecutionRole resource.

    2. Lambda Function (DefaultVpcLambda): A Lambda function, CFGetDefaultVpcId, is defined to retrieve the default VPC ID and subnets. This function uses boto3 to interact with EC2 services and returns VPC details.

    3. Custom Resource (DefaultVpcFinder): Calls the Lambda function to fetch the VPC and subnet details, allowing other resources to use this data.

    4. Lambda Execution Role (LambdaExecutionRole): An IAM role for the Lambda function, granting permissions for EC2 read-only access, S3 full access, IAM full access, SageMaker, and Lambda execution.

    5. SageMaker Domain (GenAIBookBedrockSageMakerDomain): Creates a SageMaker domain that uses IAM authentication, with default user settings tied to the execution role (GenAIBookBedrockSageMakerExecutionRole). It also includes network configurations using the default VPC and subnet IDs.

    6. SageMaker Execution Role (GenAIBookBedrockSageMakerExecutionRole): Defines an IAM role for executing SageMaker, Bedrock, and AOSS tasks. This role has attached policies granting broad access to SageMaker, Bedrock, AOSS, S3, and IAM services, though the template advises modification to adhere to the least privilege principle.

**Outputs:**

    1. Provides the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the created SageMaker domain and execution role, which can be referenced in other AWS resources or applications.

## Prerequisite

* [AWS Console access](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
* [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) access role to execute AWS CloudFormation template
* [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) access Creating Amazon SageMaker domain, Amazon SageMaker domain user, AWS Lambda, and AWS IAM roles & policies

## AWS region for implementation Amazon SageMaker domain 

us-east-1 

## Deploy resources with AWS CloudFormation

We create required resources with AWS CloudFormation, including Amazon SageMaker domain, Amazon SageMaker domain user, AWS Lambda function, and [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) (IAM) role. Complete the following steps:

1. To launch the CloudFormation stack, choose [**Launch Stack**](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create). 

![cft_launch_page](https://github.com/avikbhaaws/genai-bedrock-book-samples/blob/main/cloudformation/image/1_cft_launch_page.png)

2. Choose **Choose an existing template**. Choose **Upload a template file**. 

3. Choose File **genai-bedrock-book-samples-sagemaker-basic.yml**. Click **Next**.

4. Provide **Stack name**. 

5. Leave **UserProfileName** parameter at their default values.

![cft_create_page](https://github.com/avikbhaaws/genai-bedrock-book-samples/blob/main/cloudformation/image/2_cft_create_page.png)

6. **scroll down**. Click **Next**.

7. **scroll down**. After verifying all the options, acknowledge the message for IAM resource creation as mentioned in the following screenshot and click on the **Submit** buttion.

![cft_ack_page](https://github.com/avikbhaaws/genai-bedrock-book-samples/blob/main/cloudformation/image/3_cft_ack_page.png)

    * The stack takes about 2 minutes to complete.
    * Now that the CloudFormation stack is complete.


## Clean up

If you dont want to continue with this hands on exercise further, Please follow the **Delete** the AWS CloudFormation stack to avoid incurring future charges and to clean up unused roles and policies, delete the resources you created as part of the execution of the AWS CloudFormation stack.
